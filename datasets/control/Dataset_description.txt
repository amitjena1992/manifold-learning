Data Set Information:

This dataset contains 600 examples of control charts synthetically generated by the process in Alcock and Manolopoulos (1999). There are six different classes of control charts:

1. Normal
2. Cyclic
3. Increasing trend
4. Decreasing trend
5. Upward shift
6. Downward shift

The following image shows ten examples from each class: data.jpeg, where (A) Downward Trend. (B) Cyclic. (C) Normal. (D) Upward Shift. (E) Upward Trend. (F) Downward Shift.

Attribute Information:

The data is stored in an ASCII file, 600 rows, 60 columns, with a single chart per line. The classes are organized as follows:

1-100 Normal
101-200 Cyclic
201-300 Increasing trend
301-400 Decreasing trend
401-500 Upward shift
501-600 Downward shift
