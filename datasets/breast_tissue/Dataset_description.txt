Data Set Information:

Impedance measurements were made at the frequencies: 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 KHz
Impedance measurements of freshly excised breast tissue were made at the follwoing frequencies: 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 KHz. These measurements plotted in the (real, -imaginary) plane constitute the impedance spectrum from where the breast tissue features are computed.
The dataset can be used for predicting the classification of either the original 6 classes or of 4 classes by merging together the fibro-adenoma, mastopathy and glandular classes whose discrimination is not important (they cannot be accurately discriminated anyway).
