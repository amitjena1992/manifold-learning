# [Manifold Learning](http://github.com/lucasdavid/manifold-learning)

Final project as student at Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

Implementations and experiments for my Computer Science final report:
"A Study of The Isomap Algorithm and Its Applications in Machine Learning."

* Started on August, 2015.
* Presented on December, 2015.

### Abstract

This project aims to study the foundations of nonlinear dimensionality reduction with the algorithm
known as Isometric Mapping (or simply Isomap) and observe the application of the algorithm in practical
experiments.

The report is structured in the following way: it will first present and demonstrate important concepts
related to dimensionality reduction. It will then study and demonstrate linear dimensionality reduction
methods, as they are closely related to Isomap. Finally, Isomap will be covered, from its concept to
limitations and extensions.

The experiments here presented were developed in a linux Ubuntu 15.10 64 bits, Intel Core i7-4700MQ
CPU 2.40GHz Ã— 8, 16 GB of RAM computational environment.

### Final Project's Report

Folder [report/](report) contains the written work and all assets of it (e.g. images).
A compiled `.pdf` version can also be found [here](report/report.pdf).

### Experiments

All experiments mentioned in the report were stored at [experiments](experiments) folder.
They are named according to the following standard: `{section-id}_{object-id}_{experiment-name}.py`.
